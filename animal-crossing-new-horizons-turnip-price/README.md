## Introduction
The turnip price in Nintendo Switch Game - Animal Crossing: New Horizons

This set of data has characteristics of periodicity, trending, different patterns and random noise, which is perfect practice data for data scientist, analyst or enthusiast. 

There are existed turnip price prediction models on the internet, which are based on the previous game version and have been proved effective for New Horizons. I suggest not browsing these websites because this will bring bias to your own modeling process. Remember this dataset is only for practice purpose.
